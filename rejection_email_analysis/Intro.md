# Gmail Rejection Reader: Turning Rejection into Art

## Introduction

Ever felt like rejection could be more than just a bitter pill to swallow? Well, welcome to my quirky corner of GitHub where I've turned rejection into art! 🎨✉️

## The Idea

In a moment of digital introspection, I wondered, "What if I could extract all those 'Thanks, but no thanks' emails cluttering my Gmail inbox and turn them into something beautiful?"

## The Journey

With Python as my trusty wand, I delved into the mystical realms of email APIs and data wrangling. Through the maze of MIME types and OAuth tokens, I emerged victorious, wielding a script capable of sifting through my inbox with ease.

## The Magic

But what's the fun without a bit of magic? After gathering those pesky rejection emails, I used a tool called a word cloud maker, and those emails transformed into a colorful collage of words, making rejection look surprisingly cool.

## Conclusion

So here it is, blend of code and creativity, turning rejection into art one email at a time. And hey, who knew rejection could look so darn pretty?
